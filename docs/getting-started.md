Once you download the ZIP file, you will see several folders within. Here is the descripton for each folder:

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Folder</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Documentation</code></td>
      <td>
        Here is the documentation about the Theme. You have to open the
        <code>index.html</code> file.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>vega</code></td>
      <td>Inside you will find the actual theme. There will be a file called vega.zip.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

# Installation
In order to install the theme you have to grab the `vega.zip` file and extract
it's contents. The folder `vega` must go to your
`ghost-install/content/themes` folder
We provide you with compiled version of the theme. Please refer to **Configuration**
or **Customization** in order to find out how to customize or configure your theme.

So if you are a Ghost(Pro) user just follow this tutorial and upload that ZIP
file: [How to upload a theme to your Ghost(Pro) blog](http://support.ghost.org/upload-theme-ghostpro/)
<br>
More information about a self-hosted version of Ghost the method to upload
depends on your Server, for example here is a guide on how to upload the theme

`Activate` button next to the 'vega' theme.

# Removal
There are no special instructions about the theme removal. Just take a note that
if you decide to remove the theme files from your system, first you have to activate
another theme. Otherwise an error will occure.
